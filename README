# pplacer

This is pplacer v1.1 alpha.
It's a fairly new animal, with the emphasis being on integrating taxonomic and phylogenetic information.

No documentation yet, but some interesting things will happen if you make a [reference package](http://github.com/nhoffman/taxtastic), then run `pplacer -c my.refpkg` and `placeviz -c my.refpkg`.

I'm not offering builds yet but the [compilation](http://matsen.fhcrc.org/pplacer/compile.html) process should be fairly painless now.

Pplacer is free software under the GPL v3.
