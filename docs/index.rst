==========================

The pplacer suite consists of two separate binaries: pplacer and guppy.
The pplacer binary actually does phylogenetic placement and produces place files, while guppy does all of the downstream analysis.
Guppy can do many different things via its subcommand interface, from compressing place files to statistical comparative analysis.

   <h2> <font color="red">Warning</font> </h2>

The pplacer suite is currently in an "alpha" stage of development.
We do our best to keep everything correct, but some functionality is not completely verified and thus may contain bugs or produce unexpected results.
The general guideline is: if we have published about a method, then we have verified it and you are good to go.
If not, then we suggest that you wait to do any analysis that you intend to publish.
