Welcome to pplacer's documentation!
===================================

The pplacer suite consists of two separate binaries: pplacer and guppy.
The pplacer binary actually does phylogenetic placement and produces place files, while guppy does all of the downstream analysis. 
Guppy can do many different things via its subcommand interface, from compressing place files to statistical comparative analysis.
