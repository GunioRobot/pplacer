Calculate the center of mass of the placement distribution and write it out to a phyloXML file for viewing.
When several place files are given, calculate the barycenter for each, and mark them on the same tree.
Because phyloxml isn't actually designed to show points on the tree, the phyloXML is a kluge for the time being-- using "speciation" and "duplication" tags.
