1.1.alpha08
===========

 * `guppy edpl` now calculates the EDPL (expected distance between placement
   locations) for placements


1.1.alpha07
===========

 * Fixed a serious issue with any command that used a `--prefix` flag.


1.1.alpha06
===========

 * Closed GH-20: efficiency of kr_distance evaluated and approved.
 * Closed GH-44: improved sqlite3 support in guppy.
 * Closed GH-45: better consistency of output flags across all guppy commands.
 * Closed GH-48: better error reporting when loading json placefiles.
 * Closed GH-50: fixed the output of `guppy classify`.
 * Closed GH-51: only parsing the first word as a sequence name in a fasta file.
 * Renamed the `--normal` flag for `guppy kr` to `--gaussian` to avoid confusion
   with normalization.
 * Only one shuffle at a time is now stored in memory (big savings, obviously).
 * Fixed bug that was throwing off `guppy kr` shuffling significance estimation.
 * `guppy pca` now defaults to scaling eigenvalues to percent variance; now has
   a --raw-eval flag to specify otherwise.
 * Fixed all of the sequence parsers to be tail-recursive, so parsing large
   files no longer causes segfaults.
 * Added a `guppy redup` command for re-adding duplicate sequences to
   placefiles generated from deduplicated sequence files.


1.1.alpha05
===========

 * Closed GH-11: options for the tree-generating subcommands are more uniform.
 * Closed GH-22: added more unit tests for `guppy kr`.
 * Closed GH-32: using power iteration rather than full
   eigendecomposition. Leads to 60x speedup for PCA on demo data.
 * Closed GH-35: added a remark in the documentation about multiple comparison.
 * Closed GH-41: added docs for the json placefile format.
 * Added `guppy splitify`. Spits out differences of mass across splits.
 * Changed default behavior of `guppy kr` to not normalize, and
   correspondingly added in a `--normalize` command line flag.
 * Improved documentation.
 * Moved `guppy heat` to `guppy kr_heat`.
 * The `guppy heat` subcommand now maps an arbitrary vector to a phylogenetic
   tree contained in a reference package.
 * Removed redundant `classic` subcommand from guppy.
 * Changed `guppy round` to use the new placefile format.
 * Added support for posterior probabilities in json placefiles.
 * Removed csv and old-placefile-format generation from pplacer.
 * Added the ability to run pplacer in multiple processes in parallel with the
   -j flag.
 * Removed friend-finding from pplacer, as it was superseded by some of the
   multiprocessing code.


1.1.alpha03 to 1.1.alpha04
==========================

 * Closed GH-12: removed Placement.classif, and renamed
   Placement.contain_classif to Placement.classif.
 * Closed GH-29: added `guppy merge` to merge multiple placefiles.
 * Closed GH-30: accepting \r, \n, and \r\n as delimiters everywhere in pplacer
   and guppy.
 * Closed GH-36: added `guppy {classic,tog,sing,filter}`. The former three were
   originally a part of placeviz, and the lattermost filters placefiles to only
   a specific subset of their placements.
 * Closed GH-37: added a trailing newline to the end of json files.
 * Closed GH-38: added this changelog.
 * Bugfix in `guppy classify`. From the commit:
     Previously, a file was being opened and closed for every pquery in every
     placerun. This resulted in only the last pquery being classified and
     written out. Now only one file is being opened for each placerun.
