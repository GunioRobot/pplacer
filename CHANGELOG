1.1.alpha03 to 1.1.alpha04
==========================

 * Closed GH-12: removed Placement.classif, and renamed
   Placement.contain_classif to Placement.classif.
 * Closed GH-29: added `guppy merge` to merge multiple placefiles.
 * Closed GH-30: accepting \r, \n, and \r\n as delimiters everywhere in pplacer
   and guppy.
 * Closed GH-36: added `guppy {classic,tog,sing,filter}`. The former three were
   originally a part of placeviz, and the lattermost filters placefiles to only
   a specific subset of their placements.
 * Closed GH-37: added a trailing newline to the end of json files.
 * Closed GH-38: added this changelog.
 * Bugfix in `guppy classify`. From the commit:
     Previously, a file was being opened and closed for every pquery in every
     placerun. This resulted in only the last pquery being classified and
     written out. Now only one file is being opened for each placerun.


1.1.alpha05
===========

  * Added `guppy splitify`. Spits out differences of mass across splits.
  * Changed default behavior of `guppy kr` to not normalize, and
    correspondingly added in a `--normalize` command line flag.
  * Improved documentation.
