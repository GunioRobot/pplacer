`round` clusters the placements by rounding branch lengths.

  usage: round [options] placefile[s]

Options
=======

-o  Set the prefix to write to. Required.
--sig-figs  Set the number of significant figures used for rounding (default 3).
--cutoff  Set the rounding inclusion cutoff for the ML weight ratio (default 0.01).

Details
=======

This subcommand provides very basic "clustering" functionality.
This is not meant to derive "species level" or analogous groupings, but rather to group placements which will have essentially identical impact in a guppy analysis.

Rounding is done as follows:

  * throw out the placement mass below the ``--cutoff`` level
  * round the branch lengths to ``--sig-figs`` significant figures
  * group placements that are identical after this process.
