--pp  Use posterior probability for the weight.
--unweighted  Treat every placement as a point mass concentrated on the highest-weight placement.

-o  Set the prefix to write to. Required.
--unit-width  Set the number of pixels for a single placement (will override total-width if set).
--total-width  Set the total number of pixels for all of the mass. Default: 400
--xml  Write phyloXML (with colors) for all visualizations.
--node-numbers  Put the node numbers in where the bootstraps usually go.
--log  Set to a nonzero value to perform a logarithmic transform of the branch width.
--num-bl  Set the branch length for visualization in the number tree. Default: 0.1
--min-fat  The minimum branch length for fattened edges (to increase their visibility). To disable, specify a value of 0. Default: 0.01
