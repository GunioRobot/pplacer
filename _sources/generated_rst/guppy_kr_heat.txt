=======

`kr_heat` makes a heat tree.

::

  usage: heat [options] placefile1 placefile2

Options
=======

--pp  Use posterior probability for the weight.
--unweighted  Treat every placement as a point mass concentrated on the highest-weight placement.
--transform  A transform to apply to the read multiplicities before calculating. Options are 'log' and 'unit'. Default is no transform.
-c  Reference package path.
-p  The exponent for the integration, i.e. the value of p in Z_p.
--normalize  Divide KR by a given value. Legal arguments are "tree-length".
--min-fat  The minimum branch length for fattened edges (to increase their visibility). To turn off set to 0. Default: 0.01
--total-width  Set the total pixel width for all of the branches of the tree. Default: 300
--width-factor  Override total-width by directly setting the number of pixels per unit of thing displayed.
--gray-black  Use gray/black in place of red/blue to signify the sign of the coefficient for that edge.
--min-width  Specify the minimum width for a branch to be colored and thickened. Default is 1.
-o  Output file. Default is derived from the input filenames.

Details
=======

Draw a "heat tree" in phyloXML format.
A heat tree shows the optimal movement of dirt in the "earth movers" interpretation of the Kantorovich-Rubinstein distance.
Imagine that the dirt is moving from the placement distribution corresponding to the first place file to that in the second.
The branches are thickened in proportion to the amount of dirt which moves through that edge.
Dirt moving on an edge towards the root is marked in red, and that moving away from the root is colored in blue.
Said another way, clades which are upregulated in the first sample are colored red, and the others blue.
