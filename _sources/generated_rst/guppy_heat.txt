`heat` makes a heat tree.

::

  usage: heat [options] placefile1 placefile2

Options
=======

--pp  Use posterior probability for the weight.
--unweighted  Treat every placement as a point mass concentrated on the highest-weight placement.
--transform  A transform to apply to the read multiplicities before calculating. Options are 'log' and 'unit'. Default is no transform.
-c  Reference package path.
-p  The exponent for the integration, i.e. the value of p in Z_p.
--normalize  Divide KR by a given value. Legal arguments are "tree-length".
-o  Output file. Default is derived from the input filenames.
--color-grad  Use color gradation as well as thickness to represent mass transport.
--gray-black  Use gray and black in place of red and blue to signify the sign of the KR along that edge.
--white-bg  Make colors for the heat tree which are compatible with a white background.
--gray-level  Specify the amount of gray to mix into the color scheme. Default is 5.
--min-width  Specify the minimum width of the branches in a heat tree. Default is 0.5.
--max-width  Specify the maximum width of the branches in a heat tree. Default is 13.

Details
=======

Draw a "heat tree" in phyloXML format.
A heat tree shows the optimal movement of dirt in the "earth movers" interpretation of the Kantorovich-Rubinstein distance.
Imagine that the dirt is moving from the placement distribution corresponding to the first place file to that in the second.
The branches are thickened in proportion to the amount of dirt which moves through that edge.
Dirt moving on an edge towards the root is marked in red, and that moving away from the root is colored in blue.
Said another way, clades which are upregulated in the first sample are colored red, and the others blue.
