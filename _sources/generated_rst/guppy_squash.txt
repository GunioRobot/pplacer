`squash` performs squash clustering.

::

  usage: squash [options] placefiles

Options
=======

--pp  Use posterior probability for the weight.
--unweighted  Treat every placement as a point mass concentrated on the highest-weight placement.
--transform  A transform to apply to the read multiplicities before calculating. Options are 'log' and 'unit'. Default is no transform.
-c  Reference package path.
--seed  Set the random seed, an integer > 0. Default is 1.
-o  The output directory. Required
--bootstrap  the number of bootstrap replicates to run
--tax-cluster  Perform taxonomic clustering rather than phylogenetic.Specify "unit" or "inv" for the two different modes.

Details
=======

Bootstrapping is performed by resampling directly on placements.
Note that the bootstrap values for clustering are calculated in a rooted way.
That means that you may observe different bootstrap values on either side of the root, especially if a whole clade from one side of the root likes to flip to a location distal to the clade on the other side of the root.
