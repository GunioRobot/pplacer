`pca` performs edge principal components.

::

  usage: pca [options] placefiles

Options
=======

-o  Set the prefix to write to. Required.
--pp  Use posterior probability for the weight.
--unweighted  Treat every placement as a point mass concentrated on the highest-weight placement.
--transform  A transform to apply to the read multiplicities before calculating. Options are 'log' and 'unit'. Default is no transform.
-c  Reference package path.
--write-n  The number of principal coordinates to write out (default is 5).
--scale  Scale variances to one before performing principal components.
--multiplier  The factor by which we multiply the principal component eigenvectors to get branch thickness. Default: 50.

Details
=======

Perform edge principal components analysis ("edge PCA").
Edge PCA takes the special structure of phylogenetic placement data into account.
Consequently, it is possible to visualize the principal component eigenvectors, and it can find consistent differences between samples which may not be so far apart in the tree.

Running this command produces the following files for a run with out prefix set to ``out``:

out.rot
  The top eigenvalues (first column) then their corresponding eigenvectors.

out.trans
  The samples projected into principal coordinate space.

out.xml
  The eigenvectors visualized as fattened and colored trees.
