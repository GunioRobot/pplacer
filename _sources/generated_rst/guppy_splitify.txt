========

`splitify` writes out differences of masses for the splits of the tree.

::

  usage: splitify [options] placefile(s)

Options
=======

-o  Set the filename to write to. Otherwise write to stdout.
--pp  Use posterior probability for the weight.
--unweighted  Treat every placement as a point mass concentrated on the highest-weight placement.
--transform  A transform to apply to the read multiplicities before calculating. Options are 'log' and 'unit'. Default is no transform.

Details
=======


The first step to perform edge PCA is to make a matrix with rows indexed by the samples, and columns by the edges of the tree.
The :math:`(s,e)` entry of this matrix is the difference between the distribution of mass on either side of edge :math:`e` for the sample :math:`s`.
The ``splitify`` subcommand simply writes out this matrix.
