bary
====

`bary` draws the barycenter of a placement collection on the reference tree.

::

  usage: bary [options] placefile[s]

Options
=======

--pp  Use posterior probability for the weight.
--unweighted  Treat every placement as a point mass concentrated on the highest-weight placement.
--transform  A transform to apply to the read multiplicities before calculating. Options are 'log' and 'unit'. Default is no transform.
-o  The file to write out to. Defaults to the concatenation of the input file names.

Details
=======

Calculate the center of mass of the placement distribution and write it out to a phyloXML file for viewing.
When several place files are given, calculate the barycenter for each, and mark them on the same tree.
Because phyloxml isn't actually designed to show points on the tree, the phyloXML is a kluge for the time being-- using "speciation" and "duplication" tags.
