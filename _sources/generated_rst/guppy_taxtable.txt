taxtable
========

`taxtable` makes SQL enabling taxonomic querying of placement results.

::

  usage: taxtable [options] -c <refpkg>

Options
=======

-c  Reference package path. Required.
-o  Set the filename to write to. Otherwise write to stdout.

Details
=======

Creates two SQL tables: ``taxa`` and ``ranks``.
``taxa`` maps between taxon IDs, taxon names, and rank names.
``rank`` maps between rank names and rank levels.

The databases made from these tables can then be used in conjunction with ``guppy classify --sqlite``.

See the `microbiome demo`_ for some examples.
